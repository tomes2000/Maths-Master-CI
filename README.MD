## Design

### Imagery

The website is called Science Star; the name is designed to reassure the user that they can become a skillful scientist from participating in this quiz. As a result, I've used an image of *blank* (change this) to show user *blank*.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, game page, high score page, 500 error page and 404 error page.

All pages on the website are responsive and include:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

* The website title that allows the user to navigate back to the home page if they so require.

### The Home Page

The home page of Science Star displays the title at the top, with a container just below which features the content.  This content allows the user to interact with the quiz and also welcomes them upon their visit. There are three buttons featured which include: "Play", "How To Play" and "High Scores".

The "Play" button will take the user to the game page, where they can select the difficulty of the quiz and also a high scores button, which allows them to track their progress.

A modal feature has been implemented when the "How To Play" button is pressed. This puts the content outside of the modal out of focus, helping the user concentrate on the content enclosed within the modal.

### The Game Page

The game page of Science Star displays the title at the top, which allows the user to navigate back to the home page. Within the game page, the user has the option of choosing their respective difficulty.

Once the difficulty has been chosen, the quiz begins and the user is introduced to the quiz section which contains questions with 4 possible answers to choose from. 

The user then has one chance to correctly answer the question, once they click an answer, they are unable to re-select a different answer. If the user is correct then the quiz border section along with the button will display a green colour along with adding 10 to the score total. If the user is incorrect, then the quiz border section along with the button will display a red colour and 0 points are added to the score total.

There are a total of 10 questions. Once all 10 questions are answered, the user is redirected to the final seciton, allowing them to write their details and submit their score onto the high score page. A total of 10 scores can only be displayed, therefore the top 10 scores are only shown. Disabling the submit button until a high score name is entered prevents the user from submitting an empty field.

### Colour Scheme

#### Green

A darkish shade of green (#36C6E71) has been used due to its symbolism of [life, nature and balance](https://www.sensationalcolor.com/meaning-of-green/). This colour works very well with my idea of science as it's related to life and nature. This same colour was also included into the correct answer Buttons and Borders.

#### White

#### Black

#### Background Image

After conducting user testing and feedback sessions, the realisation that a plain green (#36C6E71) background was not very popular and resulted in a monotonous and dull user experience. As a result, I've included a vibrant image in the background of the website.
